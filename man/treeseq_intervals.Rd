\title{Get information about local trees in a tree sequence}
\usage{
treeseq_intervals(ts)
}
\arguments{
\item{ts}{A \code{treeseq} object}
}
\value{
A matrix with columns:
  \describe{
    \item{left}{Left endpoint of tree's genomic interval (inclusive)}
    \item{right}{Right endpoint of tree's genomic interval (exclusive)}
    \item{length}{Length of genomic interval (right - left)}
    \item{num_edges}{Number of edges in the tree}
    \item{num_roots}{Number of root nodes in the tree}
    \item{max_root_age}{Time of the oldest root in the tree}
  }
}
\description{
Returns details about each local tree in a tree sequence, including their genomic 
spans, number of edges, number of roots, and maximum root age.
}
\details{
A tree sequence consists of a sequence of local trees along a genome, where each 
tree represents the genealogical relationships for a specific genomic interval. 
This function summarizes key properties of each local tree.

Genomic intervals use the standard [left, right) convention where left is inclusive 
and right is exclusive. The units of these intervals (e.g., base pairs, genetic 
map positions) depend on how the tree sequence was created.

A tree can have multiple roots when there are lineages that have not yet coalesced 
at the top of the tree. The age of a root is its time value in the node table.

\examples{
# Load example tree sequence
ts <- treeseq_load(system.file("extdata", "example.trees", package="gaia"))

# Get information about all local trees
trees <- treeseq_intervals(ts)

# Find trees with multiple roots
multi_root <- which(trees[,"num_roots"] > 1)

# Find oldest tree
oldest <- which.max(trees[,"max_root_age"])
