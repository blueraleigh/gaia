\title{Access the nodes table of a tree sequence}
\usage{
treeseq_nodes(ts)
}
\arguments{
\item{ts}{A \code{treeseq} object}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns:
  \describe{
    \item{node_id}{Unique identifier for each node (0-based indexing)}
    \item{is_sample}{Logical indicating whether node represents a sample}
    \item{time}{Time ago when node existed (present = 0, increasing into past)}
    \item{population_id}{ID of population node belongs to (0-based indexing)}
    \item{individual_id}{ID of individual node belongs to (0-based indexing)}
    \item{metadata}{Raw vector containing node-specific metadata}
  }
}
\description{
Returns the nodes table from a tree sequence, which contains core information 
about all nodes including their times, population assignments, sample flags, and 
individual associations.
}
\details{
The nodes table is a fundamental component of tree sequences, storing information 
about every node that appears in the genealogical trees. Each node represents a 
haploid genome that existed at a particular time.

Nodes can be:
- Samples (observed data) or non-samples (inferred ancestors)
- Associated with specific populations
- Associated with specific individuals (e.g., maternal/paternal genomes)
- Annotated with arbitrary metadata

Times are measured backwards from the present (0), increasing into the past. The 
time units (e.g., generations, years) depend on how the tree sequence was created.

\examples{
# Load tree sequence
ts <- treeseq_load(system.file("extdata", "test.trees", package = "gaia"))

# Get nodes table
nodes <- treeseq_nodes(ts)

# Find sample nodes (0-2)
samples <- nodes[nodes$is_sample, ]

# Find oldest nodes (nodes 5 and 6 at times 0.8 and 1.0)
oldest <- nodes[nodes$time > 0.7, ]
