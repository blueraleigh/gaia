\title{Access the populations table of a tree sequence}
\usage{
treeseq_populations(ts)
}
\arguments{
\item{ts}{A \code{treeseq} object}
}
\value{
A matrix with columns:
  \describe{
    \item{population_id}{Unique identifier for each population (0-based indexing)}
    \item{metadata}{Raw vectors containing population-specific metadata}
  }
}
\description{
Returns the populations table from a tree sequence, which records information 
about distinct populations referenced by nodes. Each population can have 
associated metadata.
}
\details{
The populations table stores information about distinct populations in the tree 
sequence. Each population represents a group of nodes that can be referenced in 
the nodes table via population IDs.

Metadata can store arbitrary information about each population in a raw vector 
format. The interpretation of metadata depends on how the tree sequence was 
created.

Population IDs use 0-based indexing and are referenced by the population_id 
column in the nodes table.

\examples{
# Load tree sequence
ts = treeseq_load(system.file("extdata", "test.trees", package="gaia"))

# Get populations table
pops = treeseq_populations(ts)
