\title{S4 class representing a tree sequence}
\description{
A class that encapsulates a tree sequence - a data structure recording the 
genealogical relationships between genetic sequences. The class maintains both 
the complete tree sequence and a pointer to the current local tree being 
examined.
}
\details{
Tree sequences efficiently encode the evolutionary relationships between sequences 
by storing a sequence of local trees along a genome. Each local tree represents 
the genealogical relationships for a specific genomic interval.

The class maintains two key components:
1. The complete tree sequence containing all genealogical information
2. A pointer to one local tree, which can be updated to examine different 
   genomic positions

The current local tree can be changed using \code{treeseq_sample} and viewed 
using \code{treeseq_to_phylo}.
