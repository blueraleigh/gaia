\title{Write a tree sequence to file}
\usage{
treeseq_write(ts, filename)
}
\arguments{
\item{ts}{A \code{treeseq} object}

\item{filename}{Character string giving the path where the tree sequence should 
be saved. The path will be created if it doesn't exist.}
}
\value{
None (called for side effect)
}
\description{
Saves a tree sequence to a .trees file in tskit format. The saved file can be 
loaded back into R or used with other software that supports the tskit format.
}
\details{
The tree sequence is saved in tskit's native .trees format. This format 
efficiently encodes all tables (nodes, edges, individuals, etc.) and their 
relationships.

The saved file can be:
- Loaded back into R using \code{treeseq_load}
- Used with tskit's Python API
- Used with other software supporting the tskit format
}
\examples{
# Load tree sequence
ts = treeseq_load(system.file("extdata", "test.trees", package="gaia"))

# Save a copy to a temporary file
temp_file = tempfile(fileext = ".trees") # Create a temporary file path
treeseq_write(ts, temp_file)

# Load the copy to verify
ts2 = treeseq_load(temp_file)
}
