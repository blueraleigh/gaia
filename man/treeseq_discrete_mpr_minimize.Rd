\title{Determine optimal geographic states from minimum migration costs}
\usage{
treeseq_discrete_mpr_minimize(obj, index1 = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{Result object from \code{\link{treeseq_discrete_mpr}}}

\item{index1}{Logical indicating whether returned state assignments should use
1-based indexing (TRUE, default) or 0-based indexing (FALSE)}
}
\value{
An integer vector giving the optimal geographic state assignment for
  each node in the tree sequence. States are indexed from 1 (if index1=TRUE)
  or 0 (if index1=FALSE).
}
\description{
Uses the migration costs computed by \code{treeseq_discrete_mpr} to identify the 
optimal geographic state for each ancestral node - the state that minimizes the 
total migration cost needed to explain sample locations. When multiple states 
achieve the minimum cost, one is chosen randomly.
}
\details{
For each node, this function examines the migration costs computed by 
\code{treeseq_discrete_mpr} to identify the geographic state(s) that achieve
the minimum total cost. When multiple states achieve the minimum cost (equally 
parsimonious reconstructions), one state is selected randomly using uniform 
probability.

The function maintains consistent indexing with the input data by default
(index1=TRUE), matching the 1-based state indexing used in sample_locations
when calling \code{treeseq_discrete_mpr}. Set index1=FALSE to use 0-based
indexing, which may be more convenient when working with tree sequence node IDs.

\examples{
# Load tree sequence
ts = treeseq_load(system.file("extdata", "test.trees", package="gaia"))

# Set up discrete state reconstruction
state = c(2L,1L,1L)
samples = cbind(node_id=0:2, state_id=state)
costs = matrix(c(0, 1, 1, 0), 2, 2)
mpr_costs = treeseq_discrete_mpr(ts, samples, costs)

# Get optimal states for all nodes (0-6)
states = treeseq_discrete_mpr_minimize(mpr_costs)

# Same with 0-based state indexing
states0 = treeseq_discrete_mpr_minimize(mpr_costs, index1=FALSE)
