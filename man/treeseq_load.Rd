\title{Load a tree sequence from a file}
\usage{
treeseq_load(filename)
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{Character string giving the path to a .trees file}
}
\value{
A \code{treeseq} object containing:
  \describe{
    \item{treeseq}{External pointer to the full tree sequence}
    \item{tree}{External pointer to the current local tree, initially the first tree}
  }
}
\description{
Creates a \code{treeseq} object by loading a tree sequence from a .trees file. 
The tree sequence must be in the tskit format. This function initializes both
the full tree sequence and its first local tree.
}
\details{
The .trees file must be in the tskit format. Tree sequences can be created and 
exported to this format using tools like msprime, SLiM, or tskit's Python API.

The returned object provides access to both the complete tree sequence and its 
constituent local trees. The tree slot initially points to the first local tree, 
but can be updated to other trees using \code{treeseq_sample}.
}
\examples{
# Load example tree sequence
ts <- treeseq_load(system.file("extdata", "example.trees", package="gaia"))

# Access tables
nodes <- treeseq_nodes(ts)
edges <- treeseq_edges(ts)

# View current local tree
tree <- treeseq_to_phylo(ts)
