\title{Access the individuals table of a tree sequence}
\usage{
treeseq_individuals(ts)
}
\arguments{
\item{ts}{A \code{treeseq} object}
}
\value{
A matrix with columns:
  \describe{
    \item{individual_id}{Unique identifier for each individual (0-based indexing)}
    \item{location}{Numeric vector of spatial coordinates}
    \item{parents}{Integer vector of parent individual IDs (0-based indexing)}
    \item{metadata}{Raw vector containing individual-specific metadata}
  }
}
\description{
Returns the individuals table from a tree sequence, which records information about 
distinct individuals (organisms) represented in the tree sequence. Each individual 
can have spatial locations, parent-child relationships, and metadata.
}
\details{
The individuals table stores information about distinct organisms in the tree 
sequence. Each individual can:
- Have multiple nodes associated with it (e.g., maternal and paternal genomes)
- Be located in space via coordinates
- Have recorded parents
- Carry additional metadata

Location coordinates and parent IDs are stored as variable-length vectors for each 
individual. The interpretation of location coordinates (e.g., as geographic 
coordinates, plot coordinates) depends on how the tree sequence was created.

Individual IDs use 0-based indexing and are referenced by the individual_id 
column in the nodes table.
