\title{Select a local tree from a tree sequence}
\usage{
treeseq_sample(ts, at = -1L)
}
\arguments{
\item{ts}{A \code{treeseq} object}

\item{at}{Integer specifying which local tree to select (1-based indexing). If 
less than or equal to 0 (default), a random tree is selected with probability 
proportional to its genomic span.}
}
\value{
Integer giving the index of the selected tree (1-based)
}
\description{
Updates the current local tree pointer in a tree sequence object to reference 
either a specific tree or a randomly chosen tree. The selected tree can then be 
accessed using other functions.
}
\details{
A tree sequence consists of a sequence of local trees along a genome. This 
function updates which local tree is currently being referenced by the tree 
sequence object.

When at â‰¤ 0, a tree is chosen randomly with probability proportional to its 
genomic span. This means trees covering longer genomic intervals are more likely 
to be selected.

The selected tree becomes available for:
- Converting to phylo format via \code{treeseq_to_phylo}
- Exploring its structure and properties
- Other tree-specific operations

\examples{
# Load tree sequence
ts <- treeseq_load(system.file("extdata", "test.trees", package = "gaia"))

# Select first tree (spanning [0,20))
# "At" functionality not currently working, but it should work like this:
# treeseq_sample(ts, at=1)

# Select second tree (spanning [20,80))
# "At" functionality not currently working, but it should work like this:
# treeseq_sample(ts, at=2)

# Select a random tree, weighted by genomic span
# Most likely to select second tree as it spans 60\% of sequence
# Functionality not currently working, but it should work like this:
# treeseq_sample(ts)
